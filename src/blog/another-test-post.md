Private investigators, also known as PIs or private detectives, are professionals who are hired to conduct investigations on behalf of individuals, businesses, and organizations. They offer a wide range of services, including:

<b>Surveillance</b>: Private investigators use various techniques to monitor individuals and gather information about their activities. They may follow someone, take pictures or video, or use electronic surveillance methods to gather evidence.

<b>Background checks</b>: Private investigators can perform detailed background checks on individuals, including their criminal history, employment history, and financial history. This information can be useful for employers, landlords, and individuals who want to know more about someone before they hire, rent to, or get involved with them.

<b>Missing persons investigations</b>: Private investigators can search for missing persons, including runaway teenagers, long-lost relatives, or people who have disappeared under suspicious circumstances.

<b>Infidelity investigations</b>: Private investigators can investigate suspected infidelity and provide evidence of a partner's activities, such as photographs, videos, or recordings.

<b>Fraud investigations</b>: Private investigators can investigate fraud, including insurance fraud, financial fraud, and other types of fraudulent activities.

<b>Asset searches</b>: Private investigators can help locate assets, such as bank accounts, property, and other assets that may be hidden or difficult to find.

<b>Corporate investigations</b>: Private investigators can investigate corporate fraud, embezzlement, and other activities that may harm a company.

<b>Computer forensics</b>: Private investigators can use specialized software and techniques to recover data from computers, smartphones, and other digital devices.
